The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code.\n",

There a variety of such rules -- and different off-the-shelf tokenizers may differ in their set of rules -- but for this task focus only on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic punctuation:** The most common limitation of tokenizing only using whitespace characters is that there is no whitespace between a word token and a common punctuation mark. So we need to split this. For this, we provide you with the solution -- see the `split_token()` method below -- to illustrate how to use the method and what needs to be returned.\n",
    "* **Ellipsis:** In informal writing, an ellipsis (`...`) can be used to represent a trailing off of thought (e.g., *\"If only she had . . . Oh, it doesnâ€™t matter now.\"*) or also indicate hesitation (e.g., *\"I wasnâ€™t really . . . well, what I mean . . . see, the thing is . . . I didnâ€™t mean it.\"*), though in this case the punctuation is more accurately described as suspension points. You can assume that each ellipsis is correctly represented by 3 periods (`...`), no more no less. While some style guides suggest having a whitespace character between words and `...`, these whitespace characters are not mandatory and often omitted. So we have to take this into consideration.\n",
    "* **Clitics:** A clitic is a morpheme that has syntactic characteristics of a word, but depends phonologically on another word or phrase. A clitic is pronounced like an affix, but plays a syntactic role at the phrase level. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in *I'm* and *we've* are clitics. The negative marker *n't* as in *couldn't* etc. is typically considered a clitic. In line with most tokenizers, we also want to split clitics from the preceding word.\n",
    "* **Hyphenated words:** Most tokenizers (incl. the spaCy tokenizer) splits hyphenated words such as *long-lived*, *old-fashioned*, or *mother-in-law*. Hence, our tokenizer should do the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment & Hints**\n",
    "* All rules can be implemented using Regular Expression in a rather straightforward manner. However, you are not required to use Regular Expression for this task. For example, you can look into basic methods provided by Python such as [`split()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp), [`startswidth()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_startswith.asp) or [`endswith()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_endswith.asp).\n",
    "* Once any rule requires the split of a token, you can immediately return `components` -- see the part for handling the splitting of basic punctuation marks in `split_token()`. There is no need to check the other rules, as the loop in `tokenize()` takes care that all new subtokens get checked again if a further splitting might be required."
